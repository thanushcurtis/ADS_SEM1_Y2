For the DB design scenario (a group has selected), provide a DB design.
The submission is ONE pdf file (max 6 pages) structured as follows:

0) Title page with group information (student names and numbers)

1) A requirement analysis consisting of
	- a short (max 1 page) background report
		related to the scenario:
		knowledge about
		NHS hospitals and waiting lists, or
			suspicious activities (reports), or
			travel industry/statistics.

	- a list with 3 to 6 design assumptions (as practised in tutorial);
		the assumptions shall be relevant
		(e.g.~a student registers for exactly one course), and
		not trivial (a student has a name).

	[3 marks]

2) A textual description of the entity-relationship model.

	[3 marks]

3) A graphical description (ER diagram).
	Use one of the tools referenced on the QMPlus page;
	you may also use other tools you find or prefer.
	Let your demonstrator know, and we add the link to the page.

	Your graphical diagram must correspond to the textual description.

	[3 marks]

3) The mapping of the conceptual model to the logical model.
	This includes a description of the main steps
		(means, explain some of the steps, do not show just the tables)

	[4 marks]

4) Normalise the schema to 3NF where required.
	Explain for two examples in your design where
	a normalisation step is (or could be) required.
	If there is no normalisation required in your design,
	then construct at least one case for demonstrating
	2NF, and one case for demonstrating 3NF.
